MavensMate plugin for GitHub's Atom text editor

**IMPORTANT**
The Atom plugin for MavensMate is very much still in development. I've pushed to GitHub to give eager Force.com developers an early look at the source code as well as to provide assistance to any Atom developers who may require it. The target launch for the plugin is October 2014, however, there will be a beta-testing program late Summer 2014.
